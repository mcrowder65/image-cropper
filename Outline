1. Reduce Size of image - Done
2. Histogram Stretch (?) contrast? - Done
2.5. Convert img to grayscale? - Done
3. Binary img - thresholding - Done
4. Median Filter - Done
5. Connected Components
	- scan through the image in row-major order until you hit a non-zero pixel
	- mark the pixel and color it C
	- if this pixel has any (4 or 8)-connected neighbors that are non-zero, mark them and put them on the stack, S
	- if S is empty, done
	  else pop S and go to 2
6. Crop to get big outline
7. Connected components on big outlines - using seeds - left and right (in case there is a seam)
8. Crop one or both sides (if there is a seam)
